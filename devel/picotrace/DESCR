picotrace enables syscall trace logging for the specified processes.

The tracer uses the ptrace(2) system call to perform the tracing process.

The picotrace program has been designed to ship bare functionality only,
without pretty printing of data structures and interpreting passed arguments
to syscalls.

picotrace is designed to be a framework for other more advanced tracers and
illustration of the canonical usage of the ptrace system call. New features are
not expected unless they present a new feature in the NetBSD kernel.
