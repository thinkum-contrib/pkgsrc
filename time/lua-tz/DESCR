A lua library for time and date manipulation.

Features include:

  - Normalisation of broken down date objects
	  - allows for complex time/date manipulation logic, e.g.
            "What day is it in 2 days, 5 hours from now?"
  - Conversion between locations (time zones) using your local
    zoneinfo database.
  - `strftime` style formatting
