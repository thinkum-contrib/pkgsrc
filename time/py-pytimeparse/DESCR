A small Python library to parse various kinds of time expressions,
inspired by a StackOverflow question.

The single function pytimeparse.timeparse.timeparse defined in the
library (also available as pytimeparse.parse) parses time expressions
like the following:

    32m
    2h32m
    3d2h32m
    1w3d2h32m
    1w 3d 2h 32m
    1 w 3 d 2 h 32 m
    ...
