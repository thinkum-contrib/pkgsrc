MultiMail is an offline mail packet reader, supporting the Blue Wave,
QWK, OMEN, SOUP and OPX formats. It uses a simple curses-based
interface.

SOUP is used for Internet email and Usenet. The other formats are
primarily used with dialup (or telnet) BBSes, to save connect time and
to provide a better interface to the message base.
