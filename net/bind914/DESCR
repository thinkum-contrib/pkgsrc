BIND, the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon.  This package contains the BIND
9.14 release.

  * A new "plugin" mechanism has been added to allow query functionality
    to be extended using dynamically loadable libraries. The "filter-aaaa"
    feature has been removed from named and is now implemented as a
    plugin.
  * QNAME minimization, as described in RFC 7816, is now supported.
  * Socket and task code has been refactored to improve performance on
    most modern machines.
  * "Root key sentinel" support, enabling validating resolvers to indicate
    via a special query which trust anchors are configured for the root
    zone.
  * Secondary zones can now be configured as "mirror" zones; their
    contents are transferred in as with traditional slave zones, but are
    subject to DNSSEC validation and are not treated as authoritative data
    when answering. This makes it easier to configure a local copy of the
    root zone as described in RFC 7706.
  * The "validate-except" option allows configuration of domains below
    which DNSSEC validation should not be performed.
  * The default value of "dnssec-validation" is now "auto".
  * IDNA2008 is now supported when linking with libidn2.
  * "named -V" now outputs the default paths for files used by named and
    other tools.
