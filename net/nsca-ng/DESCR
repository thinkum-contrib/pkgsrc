The NSCA-ng package provides a client-server pair that makes the Nagios
command file accessible to remote systems. This allows for submitting
passive check results, downtimes, and many other commands to Nagios or
compatible monitoring solutions.
It can also be used for implementing distributed setups. The submitted
data is queued by the NSCA-ng server if Nagios goes down. Multiple check
results or commands can be submitted in one go, and multiline plugin
output is fully supported.
