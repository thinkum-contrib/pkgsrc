Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows
two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored
on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified
separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes
in each replica to the other.

This package contains the no-longer-maintained 2.48 release, because
unison does not interoperate across versions.  It installs the binary
as unison-2.48 so that it can be installed at the same time as
../unison.  Note that peers will need to use "-addversionno" to use
this version as a remote.
