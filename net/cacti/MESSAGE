To get cacti up and running, you have to complete these steps:

- Install & Configure MySQL database server.

  Add a 'cacti' database and 'cactiuser' user to MySQL and create the
  cacti database layout (${CACTIDIR}/cacti.sql) to MySQL:

	mysql> CREATE DATABASE cacti;
	mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cacti.* TO 'cactiuser'@'localhost'
	    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'cactiuser';
	mysql> GRANT SELECT ON mysql.time_zone_name TO 'cactiuser'@'localhost';
        mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        mysql> USE cacti;
        mysql> SOURCE ${CACTIDIR}/cacti.sql;

  If you haven't already imported your MySQL timezone data, you need to run
	mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root -p mysql

 The Cacti Setup Assistant will ask you to set or adjust database
 parameters in my.cnf.

- Install & Configure an Apache webserver.

  Append this to Apache webserver's "httpd.conf", and restart the server.

        Include etc/httpd/httpd-cacti.conf

- For older PHP installations that do not support
  ${PKG_SYSCONFBASE}/php.d/, you will need to manually add these lines
  to enable php extensions required by cacti in
  ${PKG_SYSCONFBASE}/php.ini

	extension=gmp.so
	extension=ldap.so
	extension=gettext.so
	extension=pdo.so
	extension=pdo_mysql.so
	extension=snmp.so
	extension=sockets.so
	extension=zlib.so
	extension=mbstring.so
	extension=posix.so

  You will want to adjust the following parameters in php.ini
	memory_limit = 400M (minimum)
	max_execution_time = 60 (seconds, minimum)
	date.timezone

- Add the following lines to ${CACTI_USER}'s crontab

# Invoke poller.php to collect SNMP statistics.
*/5 * * * *	${PREFIX}/bin/cacti-poller

  and make sure ${PREFIX}/bin is in PATH.

Please read the documentation under ${CACTIDIR}/docs/
for more information about configuring and starting cacti.

If you have updated from a version older than 0.8.8h, note that the
rrd and log directories are now under ${VARBASE}. Old logs and
database files need to be moved manually, and you have to update the
log path in "Console:Settings:Paths:Logging".

Note: During the web setup of v1.2.3, you may get stuck on the page
"Critical Binary Locations" because of a missing "Cacti Log Path" entry.

Even after entering the proper ${VARBASE}/log/cacti/cacti.log,
installation may not continue. In this case, using a different browser
may help, see <https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/issues/2621>.
