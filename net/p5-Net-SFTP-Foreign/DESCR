SFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol and is a method of
transferring files between machines over a secure, encrypted
connection (as opposed to regular FTP, which functions over an
insecure connection). The security in SFTP comes through its
integration with SSH, which provides an encrypted transport layer over
which the SFTP commands are executed.

Net::SFTP::Foreign is a Perl client for the SFTP version 3 as
defined in the SSH File Transfer Protocol IETF draft, which can be
found at http://www.openssh.org/txt/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.txt

This implementation uses an external OpenSSH-compatible program.
