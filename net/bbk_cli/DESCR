Bredbandskollen's test gives you a measurement that you can compare to the
rate you pay for with your ISP, while at the same time, with the help of the
results, you can make sure that your technical equipment is working properly.
This tool is primarily intended for the swedish consumer ISP market, but
works well in most of northern and central Europe.
