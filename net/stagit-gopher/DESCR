stagit generates .gph geomyidae pages for a Git repository, and
supports the following features:

- Log of all commits from HEAD.
- Log and diffstat per commit.
- Show file tree with line numbers.
- Show references: local branches and tags.
- Detect README and LICENSE file from HEAD and link it as a page.
- Detect submodules (.gitmodules file) from HEAD and link it as a page.
- Atom feed log (atom.xml).
- Make index page for multiple repositories with stagit-gopher-index.
- After generating the pages (relatively slow) serving the files is very fast,
  simple and requires little resources (because the content is static), only
  a geomyidae Gopher server is required.
