Mozilla Thunderbird is a redesign of the Mozilla mail component. The
goal is to produce a cross platform stand alone mail application using
the XUL user interface language. This version uses the gtk2 toolkit.

This is is the last version of Thunderbird without a dependency on Rust.

The latest version (in mail/thunderbird) should be preferred on supported
platforms.
