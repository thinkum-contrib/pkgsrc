As an alternative to the LaTeX standard environments quotation
and quote, the package provides a consolidated environment for
displayed text. First-line indentation may be activated by
adding a blank line before the quoting environment. A key-value
interface (using kvoptions) allows the user to configure font
properties and spacing and to control orphans within and after
the environment.
