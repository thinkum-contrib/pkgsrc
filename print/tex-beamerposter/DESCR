The package enables the user to use beamer style operations on
a canvas of the sizes provided by a0poster; font scaling is
available (using packages such as type1cm if necessary). In
addition, the package allows the user to benefit from the nice
colour box handling and alignment provided by the beamer class
(for example, with rounded corners and shadows). Good looking
posters may be created very rapidly. Features include: scalable
fonts using the fp and type1cm packages; posters in A-series
sizes, and custom sizes like double A0 are possible; still
applicable to custom beamer slides, e.g. 16:9 slides for a
wide-screen (i.e. 1.78 aspect ratio); orientation may be
portrait or landscape; a 'debug mode' is provided.
