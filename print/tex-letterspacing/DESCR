Space out the letters of text; the command is
\letterspace<\hbox modifier>{<text>}: the text is placed in an
\hbox of the specified size, and space is inserted between each
glyph to make the text fit the box. Note that letterspacing is
not ordinarily considered acceptable in modern typesetting of
English.
