This is an experimental package aiming to provide a different
approach for multidocument works (mainly, books with a document
per chapter). Unlike the \include mechanism, every subdocument
is a complete normal LaTeX document and may be typeset
separately. What the package does is sharing the .aux files.
The present release is an alpha version, and no attempt has yet
been made to allow it to work with, say, hyperref.
