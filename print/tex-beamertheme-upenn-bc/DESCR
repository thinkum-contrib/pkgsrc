Beamer themes in the colors of the University of Pennsylvania,
USA, and Boston College, USA. Both were tested for the
presentation theme 'Warsaw'. Please note that these color
themes are neither official nor exact! The colours are
approximated from the universities' style guidelines and
websites, and slightly modified where necessary to generate an
appealing look. The universities neither endorse, nor provide
any support for, these color themes. I give no warranty for the
code.
