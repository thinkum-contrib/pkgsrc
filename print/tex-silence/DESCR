The package allows the user to filter out unwanted warnings and
error messages issued by LaTeX, packages and classes, so they
won't pop out when there's nothing one can do about them.
Filtering goes from the very broad ("avoid all messages by such
and such") to the fine-grained ("avoid messages that begin
with..."). Messages may be saved to an external file for later
reference.
