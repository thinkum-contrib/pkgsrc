This package fixes the frame numbering in beamer when using an
appendix such that the slides from the appendix are not counted
in the total frame number of the main part of the document. The
total frame number counter is reset to 0 when entering the
appendix. The standard usage is to include
\usepackage{appendixnumberbeamer} in the preamble and then
declare the beginning of the appendix as usual using the
\appendix command.
