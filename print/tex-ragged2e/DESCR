The package defines new commands \Centering, \RaggedLeft, and
\RaggedRight and new environments Center, FlushLeft, and
FlushRight, which set ragged text and are easily configurable
to allow hyphenation (the corresponding commands in LaTeX, all
of whose names are lower-case, prevent hyphenation altogether).
