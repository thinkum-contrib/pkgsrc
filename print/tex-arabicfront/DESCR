This package modifies the definitions of \frontmatter and
\mainmatter so that page numbering starts in arabic style from
the front matter while preserving the rest of the original
definitions. For it to work, \pagenumbering has to be inside
these macros--most of classes do that, but there are exceptions
like memoir.
