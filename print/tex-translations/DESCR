This package (once part of the exsheets package), provides a
framework for providing multilingual features to a LaTeX
package. The package has its own basic dictionaries for
English, Dutch, French, German and Spanish; it aims to use
translation material for English, Dutch, French, German,
Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Turkish, Croatian, Hungarian, Danish
and Portuguese from babel or polyglossia if either is in use in
the document. (Additional languages from the multilingual
packages may be possible: ask the author.)
