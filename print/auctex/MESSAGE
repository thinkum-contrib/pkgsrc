To customize AUCTeX, you will need to edit the file

	`${LISPDIR}/tex-site.el'

in the site-lisp directory.  Add the parts of `tex.el' (in the
`auctex' subdirectory) which need to be changed to `tex-site.el'.
This way, your customizations will not get deleted when you update to
a newer version of AUCTeX.

Users may then put

	(load "auctex.el" nil t t)
	(load "preview-latex.el" nil t t)

in their (X)Emacs init file.

If your site TeX macro files and style files are in a location
different from `${PREFIX}/share/texmf/tex', set `TeX-macro-global' to
the directory in your (X)Emacs init file:

	;;; Note that the directory name must end with a slash!
	(setq TeX-macro-global "/home/foo/my/tex/")
