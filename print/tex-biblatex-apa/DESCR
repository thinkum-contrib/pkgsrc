This is a fairly complete BibLaTeX style (citations and
references) for APA (American Psychological Association)
publications. It implements and automates most of the
guidelines in the APA 7th edition style guide for citations and
references. An example document is also given which typesets
every citation and reference example in the APA 7th edition
style guide. This version of the package requires use of
csquotes [?]4.3, BibLaTeX [?]3.4, and the biber backend for
BibLaTeX [?]2.5.
