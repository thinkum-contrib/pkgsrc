doas is a port of OpenBSD's doas which runs on FreeBSD, Linux and
NetBSD.

The doas utility is a program originally written for OpenBSD which
allows a user to run a command as though they were another
user. Typically doas is used to allow non-privleged users to run
commands as though they were the root user. The doas program acts as
an alternative to sudo, which is a popular method in the Linux
community for granting admin access to specific users.

The doas program offers two benefits over sudo: its configuration file
has a simple syntax and it is smaller, requiring less effort to audit
the code. This makes it harder for both admins and coders to make
mistakes that potentially open security holes in the system.
