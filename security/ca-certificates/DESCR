This package provides the certificates distributed by the Mozilla
Project and will, by default, install certificates trusted by the
Mozilla Project in the system certificate store.

The sysadmin can configure the list of trusted certificates and also
add local certificates as needed by editing ca-certificates.conf and
re-running update-ca-certificates.
