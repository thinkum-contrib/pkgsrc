A comprehensive OpenSSL module for Lua.

It includes support for certificate and key management, key generation,
signature verification, and deep bindings to the distinguished name,
alternative name, and X.509v3 extension interfaces.

It also binds OpenSSL's bignum, message digest, HMAC, cipher, and CSPRNG
interfaces. The end goal is to bind almost everything that OpenSSL supports,
but no more. It's intended as a low-level interface.

Basic bindings to OpenSSL's SSL* session and SSL_CTX* prototype objects are
available, but they cannot yet be used standalone to do SSL I/O. cqueues
supports SSL/TLS sockets internally, accepts an SSL_CTX* object from Lua
code for session configuration, and exports an SSL* object to Lua for session
introspection.
