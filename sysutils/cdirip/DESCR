This is a small program capable of extracting all the tracks contained in a
CDI (DiscJuggler) image. Both 2.0 and 3.0 CDI image versions are supported.
This will allow users which cannot use this software (either by software
incompatibilities or having an unsupported OS such as Linux or Mac OS) to burn
the contents of such images, which have a propietary format not supported by
any other recording software.

So this program will allow you to record the contents of a DiscJuggler image
with another CD-recording application. Any program that understands standard
WAV audio files and ISO or BIN images will do the job, such as CDR-Win,
cdrecord, WinOnCD or Fireburner.
