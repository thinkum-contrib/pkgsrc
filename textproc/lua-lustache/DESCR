lustache allows you to use the Mustache templating standard in Lua by
passing in a string, data, and partial templates. It precompiles and
caches templates for speed, and allows you to build complex strings such
as html pages by iterating through a table and inserting values. Find out
more about Mustache at https://mustache.github.io.
