Inifile is a lua library for parsing and writing ini files.

It supports multiple backends, these are:

- io: The lua i/o library backend, the default.
- memory: The memory backend uses the filename as input, and returns
  the output on write.
- love: Uses LOVE's love.filesystem, this is the default when LOVE
  is detected.
