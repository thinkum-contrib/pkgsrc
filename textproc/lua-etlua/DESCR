Allows you to render ERB style templates but with Lua. Supports <%
%>, <%= %> and <%- %> tags (with optional newline slurping) for
embedding code.

How it works:

- Templates are transparently translated into Lua code and then
  loaded as a function. Rendering a compiled template is very fast.

- Any compile time errors are rewritten to show the original source
  position in the template.

- The parser is aware of strings so you can put closing tags inside
  of a string literal without any problems.
