Coma is a minimalistic X11 Window Manager.

It has 2 framing modes: default, large. Only one can be active at a given
time and is specified at startup time:

- Default means it will split up your screen into columns just large enough
to fit 80 column xterms.

- Large means it will calculate the frames based on 161 column xterms (so
one can use tmux and split it to get 80 columns in each pane).
