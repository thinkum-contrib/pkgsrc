InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server. It was
created from scratch to be stable, modern and lightweight.

It provides a tunable number of features through the use of an
advanced but well documented module system. By keeping core
functionality to a minimum we hope to increase the stability,
security and speed of InspIRCd while also making it customisable
to the needs of many different users.
