InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server.

It was created from scratch to be stable, modern and lightweight.
It avoids a number of design flaws and performance issues that
plague other more established projects, such as UnrealIRCd, while
providing the same level of feature parity.

This is the legacy 2.0.x branch, kept for config compatibility.

It is still maintained, but please use chat/inspircd3 if you don't
need configuration compatibility.
