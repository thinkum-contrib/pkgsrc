HTML::Template::Compiled is a template system which can be used for HTML::Template
templates with almost the same API. It offers more flexible template delimiters,
additional tags and features, and by compiling the template into perl code it can
run significantly faster in persistent environments such as FastCGI or mod_perl.

The goal is to offer more features for flexibility but keep the basic syntax
as easy as it is.
