Firefox Decrypt is a tool to extract passwords from profiles of
Mozilla (Fire/Water)fox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, and some derivates.

It can be used to recover passwords from a profile protected by a
Master Password as long as the latter is known. If a profile is
not protected by a Master Password, a password will still be
requested but can be left blank.

This tool does not try to crack or brute-force the Master Password
in any way. If the Master Password is not known it will simply fail
to recover any data.
